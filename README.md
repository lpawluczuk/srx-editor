srx-editor
==========

This is Netbeans Plugin created for editing and testing SRX setnence splitting rules. 

This plugin allows you to edit srx rules as a simple xml file, create projecs containing rules and test documents and also run srx splitter against choosen documents. 

As a SRX sentence splitting algorithm I've used (linked to this project) Segment library which you can find here: http://segment.sourceforge.net/. 

Feel free to use, update or redistribute this project. 

Enjoy:)
